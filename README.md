This project uses different deep learning algorithms and all dataset are stored at Data folder.

## Deep Neural Network Classifer for DAC:
* Draw A Circel (DAC) is a We use DAC data to train a Deep Neural Network Classifer. The number of vectors in each DAC profile is around 140-180. The number of vector in each profile is not suffeceint to train a Deep Neural Network Classifer. We used oversampling technique to increase the profile size.
